# Preparing Sindhi Kadhi (A tangy and cultural dish)
Sindhi kadhi is an excellent example where all the vegetables are used beautifully to complement each other in taste, colour and texture.

Sindhi cuisine has always been very nutritious with a predominant use of vegetables in each and every dish. Kadhi Chawal or Kadhi Rice is one such recipe which is easy to cook and is loved by majority of sindhi community people. It serves as a unique dish for the social gatherings and functions and symbolizes the amalgamation of variety of vegetables, thus providing a nutritional value.

This tangy gram flour based curry contains lots of assorted vegetables and might seem a heavier dish because of gram flour (besan) used in its making.

The following procedure explains how to prepare Sindhi Kadhi:
- Preparation time: 10mins 
- Cooking time: 25mins
- Serves: 4

## Prerequisites
- Finely chopped cluster beans, drumsticks, carrots, cauliflower
- Peeled and cubed potatoes
- Vertically sliced ladies finger

## Procedure
1. Boil the cluster beans, potato and carrots in 2 cups of water till they are tender. Keep aside, retaining the water.
2. In a heavy-based pan, heat oil, add fenugreek seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves. Add asafoetida when they crackle.
3. Add the ginger and sauté over high flame to a light brown color.
4. Mix in the gram flour and sauté for 5-10mins over a medium flame till the mixture tends to collect together. 
5. Add salt, turmeric, green chilies and chili powder and mix well. 
6. Gradually add water, stirring continuously so that no lumps are formed. Bring to a boil. 
7. Add tomatoes and blend well. Stir-in the mixed vegetables along with the tamarind pulp; simmer till the vegetables are cooked through.
8. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.
